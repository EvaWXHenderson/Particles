# Simulation of Particles
An attempt at simulating particles and their interactions, displayed to indicate phase-characterisitcs (e.g. gas-like, liquid-like, solid-like appearance). Particles modelled are intended to resemble hydrogen molecules, gravity not taken into account.

Utilises root-mean-square (RMS) velocities and masses in amu.
